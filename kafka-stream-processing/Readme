# Kafka Tunnel
# Tunnel will go to background after entering password
$ ssh -L 9092:localhost:9092 tunnel@128.2.204.215 -NTf

# Login to PostgreSQL
# psql -U <username> <database>
$ psql -U teamjp recommendation_service

# To terminate the scripts cleanly, you need to send a SIGTERM signal to the scripts. 
# The SIGTERM handler will ensure that the kafka and database resources are released properly.
# What you need to do is-
1. Execute 'ps -eaf | grep <name of the script>.py' to get the pid for the running script. 
2. Execute 'kill <pid>' to send SIGTERM to the process. 

# While executing the script, if you get some exeception with the brokers, then restart the tunnel. 
# Steps to restart the tunnel-
1. Execute 'ps -eaf | grep tunnel' to get the pid of the tunnel running in the background. 
2. Execute 'kill -9 <pid>' to send SIGKILL to the process. 

# Execute scripts as nohup processes to ensure that they keep running even if your ssh session dies. 
# Example - 
$ nohup python3 online-eval.py &

# Online Evalution 
# The evaluation updates the recommendation table with positive outcome or negative outcome with respect to the ratings stream.
# Subsequently we are running online-evaluation-logging using a chrontab job to run every day to log the performance of our model.
